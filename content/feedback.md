# Student Feedback

Here's what students have said about my training sessions:

> "You really do have a gift for taking new concepts that are difficult to grasp and making them accessible."
> –JF, UNIX Systems Admin, Airlines Reporting Corp.

> "Nothing comes close to the quality of training from Vertical Sysadmin."
> –Nicholas, Senior System Administrator at a Fortune 10 company

> "Very personal approach to teaching. We are bored to death with PowerPoint slides. Most of the class was hands on."
> –Prakash Rudraraju

> "This is the best training session I ever attended!! Cannot give any rating less than '5', excellent!!"
> –Padma Veda, Security Specialist at a Fortune 10 company

> "Thank you for such a great class. Been to lots of technical training and you are the best instructor I've had."
> –Thomas Nicholson

> "I had been hitting a real roadblock with understanding the relationships between promises, bundles and bodies. I don't know if it was from tunnel vision from CF2 or just general thick headedness, but for some reason things just weren't clicking. For whatever reason, the mysterious glue that was keeping me from "getting it" showed up during the webinar. So for me, it was a huge benefit."
> –Sean Johnson

> "The questions I had that I cannot get from the website nor forums have been answered. Moreover, having a expert teaching the product also helps a lot."
> –Jerome Yanga, Systems Administrator at ESRI

> "The examples presented were easy to follow and provided me the chance to ask questions. You were very thorough about your explanation of various aspects of the CFEngine software and were always willing to go over things more as people had questions that they needed to ask."
> –C.L.

> "Good attention to detail and making sure all points were understood."
> –M.S.
