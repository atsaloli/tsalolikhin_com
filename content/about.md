I am a UNIX/Linux systems administrator and trainer, here to help keep the lights on for our sociotechnical civilization.

## Professional Background

I am a master generalist systems administrator, with a specialty in configuration management.

I've mentored, apprenticed and trained system administrators and other fine operations professionals.

### Notable Experience

I have worked in a variety of environments, large and small. I've been the only sysadmin and I've been a member of a large team. More than once, I've been the first sysadmin/DevOps/SRE hire.

I started my UNIX Sysadmin career at EarthLink in the late nineties as the Internet went mainstream.

I helped digital cinema explode onto the scene and replace film faster than anyone expected in the oughties at Deluxe Digital Cinema.

I helped the sysadmin community adopt configuration management in the teens as a writer, speaker, trainer and consultant through my company [Vertical Sysadmin](http://www.verticalsysadmin.com).

In the twenties I was part of another explosive growth event, the advent of our AI overlords, as the first SRE at Perplexity AI.

I am now working at Yahoo, helping to operate one of the world's largest infrastructures.

## Personal Background

I'm from a country that doesn't exist any more, the Soviet Union.

I was in Kyiv, Ukraine in 1982 when we celebrated its 1,500th anniversary.

There is a big wall around Kyiv and a set of gates called the Golden Gate. It didn't help when the Mongols came.

I was in Kyiv in 1986 when Chernobyl happened. The mushrooms and chestnuts grow to unusual size that fall. Nobody took them, they looked too unnatural.

After the nuclear power station accident, we moved to Odessa for the summer and then to Tallinn, Estonia, for about a year. Part of my heart is still in Kloogarand, on the shore of the Baltic Sea. I saw the dunes slowly moving in the wind, one grain of sand at a time.

We came back to Kyiv in 1988 to finalize our immigration paperwork and came to the USA. I have a whole story about how my family was permitted to leave, then denied permission, then permitted to leave again ten years later.

I am grateful my family brought me to America. I was 12 years old at the time.

I went to high school in Los Angeles and attended Brandeis University outside Boston.

My professional education consisted of on-the-job training at EarthLink and classes at [USENIX LISA](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/byname/5).

I now live in Central Texas, Hill Country, with my wife, daughter and three doodles. You can get a taste of our country life in [Photography](/photography/).
