# Aleksey Tsalolikhin

I am a UNIX/Linux systems administrator and trainer, here to help keep the lights on for our sociotechnical civilization.

## Professional Background

I am a master generalist systems administrator, with specialties in configuration management, CI/CD and establishing teams of sysadmins.

I've delivered professional training privately and publicly, including at USENIX LISA, SoCal Linux Expo, Ohio Linux Fest, Texas Linux Fest, IBM SHARE, ShellCon and many more.

## Notable Experience

I have worked in a variety of environments, large and small. I've been both the only sysadmin and a member of a large team. More than once, I've been the first sysadmin/DevOps/SRE hire, in a fast-growing company, and left behind an established smooth-running team.

I've started my sysadmin career at EarthLink in the late nineties as the Internet went mainstream; I helped digital cinema explode onto the scene and replace film faster than anyone expected in the oughties as a sysadmin/architect and then Director of Operations at Deluxe Digital Cinema; I helped the sysadmin community adopt configuration management tooling and mindset in the two thousand teens as a writer, speaker, trainer and consultant through my company [Vertical Sysadmin](http://www.verticalsysadmin.com) and in the twenties I was part of another explosive growth event (the advent of LLM chatbots) as the first SRE at Perplexity AI.

I am now working at Yahoo, helping to operate one of the world's largest infrastructures.
