I am a UNIX/Linux systems administrator and trainer, here to help keep the lights on for our sociotechnical civilization.

## Professional Background

I am a master generalist systems administrator, with a specialty in configuration management and establishing teams of sysadmins.

I've delivered professional training privately and publicly, including at USENIX LISA, SoCal Linux Expo, Ohio Linux Fest, Texas Linux Fest, IBM SHARE, ShellCon and many more.

## Notable Experience

I have worked in a variety of environments, large and small. I've been both the only sysadmin and a member of a large team. More than once, I've been the first sysadmin/DevOps/SRE hire, in a fast-growing company, and left behind an established smooth-running team.

I've started my sysadmin career at EarthLink in the late nineties as the Internet went mainstream; I helped digital cinema explode onto the scene and replace film faster than anyone expected in the oughties as a sysadmin/architect and then Director of Operations at Deluxe Digital Cinema; I helped the sysadmin community adopt configuration management tooling and mindset in the two thousand teens as a writer, speaker, trainer and consultant through my company [Vertical Sysadmin](http://www.verticalsysadmin.com) and in the twenties I was part of another explosive growth event (the advent of LLM chatbots) as the first SRE at Perplexity AI.

I am now working at Yahoo, helping to operate one of the world's largest infrastructures.

## Personal Background

I'm from a country that doesn't exist any more. President Ronald Reagon once called it the "Evil Empire" and now they are acting pretty evil again.

I was in Kyiv, Ukraine in 1982 when we celebrated its 1,500th anniversary.

There is a big wall around Kyiv and a set of gates called the Golden Gate. It didn't help when the Mongols came.

I was also in Kyiv in 1986 when Chernobyl happened. I saw the mushrooms and the chestnuts grow to unusual size that fall.

After the accident at Chernobyl, we moved to Odessa for the summer and then to Tallinn, Estonia, for about a year. Part of my heart is still there in Tallinn and in Kloogarand, on the shore of the Baltic Sea. There is nothing like watching the dunes slowly move in the wind, one grain of sand at a time.

We came back to Kyiv in 1988 to finalize our immigration paperwork and came to the USA. I have a whole story about how my family was permitted to leave, then denied permission, then permitted to leave again ten years later.

I am grateful they brought me to America. I was 12 years old at the time.

I went to high school in Los Angeles and attended Brandeis University outside Boston.

I now live in Central Texas, Hill Country, with my wife, daughter and three doodles. You can get a taste of our country life in [Photography](/photography/).
